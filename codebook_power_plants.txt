We have measurements on 92 power plants / decision making units (DMUs), over 11 years from 1985-1995.  An important regulatory policy was annouced at the end of 1990.
The policy, Title IV of the 1990 CAA, mandated Phase I reductions by some plants effective in 1995.
Each DMU observation is a coal-fired electric plant that generates multiple outputs using multiple inputs.

##Observations by:
* `Year`
* `PlantID`
* `PlantName`

##The three outputs are:
* `(Y) Energy`, electrical generation measured in GWh scaled as daily average
* `(Z1) SO2`, sulphur dioxide emissions measured in short tons scaled as daily average
* `(Z2) NOX`, mono-nitrogen oxide (nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2) emissions measured in short tons scaled as daily average

The first output, Energy, is an intended output.  The SO2 and NOX are unintended by-products of the production process.

##The five inputs are:
* `(X1) Capital`, stock measured as aggregated changes in annual net investment on P&E expenditures converted to 1973 base year USD using the HWI
* `(X2) Labor`, employees per plant as an annualized average
* `(X3) CoalHeat`, measured in Gwh scaled as daily average
* `(X4) OilHeat`, measured in Gwh scaled as daily average
* `(X5) GasHeat`, measured in Gwh scaled as daily average

The first two inputs are non-fuel inputs.  The last three inputs are fuel inputs.

##Added Features
* `Phase I`, dummy (binary) feature identifying whether or not plant was required to comply with Phase I SO2 reductions via Title IV of 1990 CAA (coded 1 for regulated)
* `PolYr`, dummy (binary) feature identifying whether the CAA Phase I policy was announced already (coded 1 for post 1990)
* `GrossCons`, gross consumption of heat energy summed over coal, oil, and natural gas sources measured in Mwh (thousands) scaled as daily average
* `NetCons`, net consumption of heat energy summed over coal, oil, and natural gas sources minus energy generated measured in Mwh (thousands) scaled as daily average
